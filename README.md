CM-AutoTether
=============

refactored code from https://github.com/jonhannis/CM-AutoTether
no longer statically linked to 10.1 
tested on 12.1 cyanmodgen nexus 7 2012

should work with all cyanmodgen versions up to 13 or marshmellow

*tested on 2013 12.1 as well, but tether and adb icons hang in systembar, still works tho*

Fucking android building system took longer to learn then actually changing the code, so feel free to fuck off if you dont like.
